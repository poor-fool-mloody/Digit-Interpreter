# Digit-Interpreter
## Overview
Classification algorithm for interpreting digits using Python and MNIST dataset based on k Nearest Neighbours machine learning algorithm implemented from scratch by myself.
## 1. Requirements
- Python 3.x
## 2. Build and run setup
1. Download MNIST dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv and extract it to project main folder
2. Run project. 
When process end inside project folder will appear two files: 
- classification.csv - contain sets of real vaule digits and matching them digits predicted by algorithm for k=1..k neighbours
- errors.csv - contain total amount of bad predictions for k=1..k neighbours
Also process will draw chart showing statistics total number of good predictions to bad predictions depending on number of neighbours.
